# MTRNN
implementation of multiple timescale recurrent neural network

now constructing...

##MNIST example
data.py is from https://github.com/pfnet/chainer/tree/master/examples/mnist

for the RNN implementation, each images is sliced per row pixel. So, RNN predict row pixel group from up to bottom.
